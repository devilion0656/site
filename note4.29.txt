The problem statement:‌
We are going to ‌use‌ a software tool to merge 2 sheets: one is the official student roster,
the other, typically, the grades coming from the ‌third-party‌ system, such as ‌Runstone‌.
The issue is that the name lists from ‌both‌ sides are not 100% matching.
This is our raw design of a front-end web app for solving the problem. There should be
two textareas sitting side by side. The left ‌one‌ will hold the official student roster,
and the right ‌one‌ holds the data from the ‌third-party‌ system.
‌There‌ should be ‌buttons‌ for ‌opening files‌, ‌parsing‌ the content of ‌files‌ to generate data 
‌sheets‌.
Each sheet is 2D, ‌has‌ headings.
We ‌need to‌ match the ID columns and identify mismatches to allow users to do manual matches.
For matched rows of the data, the desired columns of data from ‌right‌ should be merged to 
the left, and then allow users to download the merged file.
